Feels weird to write in a new language even though the only thing I do different is the way I/O is handled. I am coutting `std::cout` and redirecting stuff in there `std::cout << "hello"`.

I does a lot of the work for you... It doesn't work completely but a good start.

Apparently I have to try not to write in C which seems rather tricky. However while reading the subject I found out about some [videos](https://elearning.intra.42.fr/notions/piscine-c-d00-c-basics/subnotions). Who would have thought reading the subject material could be useful!
