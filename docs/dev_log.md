Feels weird to write in a new language even though the only thing I do different is the way I/O is handled. I am coutting `std::cout` and redirecting stuff in there `std::cout << "hello"`.

I does a lot of the work for you... It doesn't work completely but a good start.

Apparently I have to try not to write in C which seems rather tricky. However while reading the subject I found out about some [videos](https://elearning.intra.42.fr/notions/piscine-c-d00-c-basics/subnotions). Who would have thought reading the subject material could be useful!

Also from [Haglobah's github](https://haglobah.github.io/Mastering-42/holy_graph/cpp00-04.html) the following steps as guidelines:
- Read through the subject
- Take note of every word/concept you do not understand.
- Use the internet to research on these topics.
- Once you have a basic grasp of what all topics discussed are you start writing code.

So with that in mind: Let's read through the subject!
- [ ] Namespaces
- [ ] Classes
- [ ] member functions
- [ ] stdio streams
- [ ] initialization list
- [ ] Object Orientated Programming
- [ ] Orthodoc Canonical Form
- [ ] Guards
- [ ] Private and Public

Skip module 02 for now as you may.
